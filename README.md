# Cluster-Comparison-Algorithms
A collection of 5 different cluster comparison algorithms based on https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewFile/6103/6402

##Prerequisities

1. C++ must be installed


##Algorithms
  5 different algorithms are available - 
- F Measure(C++)
- Greedy Many To One(C++)
- Rand Index(C++)
- VI and NVI(C++, bundled in one file together)

##Build
 A build.sh script is present in each directory to build the executable.

#Run
 A sample run script is available in each directory. 

##Sample
 A sample undirected simple graph with only 5 nodes has been added in the sample_input_output folder, along with two communities for that graph. The outputs from the clustering comparison algorithms are also present in that folder.
